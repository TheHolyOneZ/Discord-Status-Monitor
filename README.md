# Discord Status Monitor

The **Discord Status Monitor** is a bot extension that allows you to display the status of your Discord bots, websites, and other services directly in a Discord channel. It's great for keeping your community informed about the health of your services.

## ✨ Features

* **Customizable Status Embed:** The bot creates a single, organized message that automatically updates with the status of your monitored services.

* **Monitor Anything:** Add and track the status of your own Discord bots, any website URL, and custom services (like your game server or database).

* **Official Discord Status:** Keep an eye on the official Discord services like the Gateway and Voice servers.

* **Easy Setup:** All management is handled through a simple in-app admin panel, so you don't need to edit any code.

* **Automatic Updates:** The status embed refreshes automatically at a set interval. You can also trigger a manual refresh at any time.
